1. Software To Be Installed:
------------------------------
	* Node JS
		- Download and install the latest version from https://nodejs.org/en/download
		- After installing you will get the Run Time Environment.  How to confirm --> Goto command prompt and type node it will display the node version
	* Visual Studion Code
		- Download and install the latest version from code.visualstudio.com
	* Playwright Module
		- This can be installed inside the VSCode itself
		- Goto https://playwright.dev/docs/intro
			1. Goto VSCode and create a folder(Project/Framework folder)
			2. Open that folder
			3. Goto the terminal and install the Playwright by using the below command,
					npm init playwright@latest
						- Press 'Y' to continue with TypeScript
						- Press 'Y' to "Where to put end-to-end tests?"
						- Press 'N' to "Add a GitHub Actions work-flow"
						- Press 'Y' to "Install Playwright browsers"
	* ES Lint
		- This can be installed inside the VSCode itself
		- Goto the Extension and search for "ESLint"
					- Install the plugins from the Microsoft.com and not anything else.
				
	* Playwright Runner Extension
		- This can be installed inside the VSCode itself
		- Goto the Extension and search for "Playwright"
					- Install the plugin "Playwright Test for VSCode" from Microsoft.com
	* Git
		- Download from https://git-scm.com/install/windows
		


2. Organizing the Project Structure and Install Browser Engines:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
	* Creating the folders
			- Copy & Paste all commands below into the Terminal in one shot/go
					mkdir -p src/tests
					mkdir -p src/pages
					mkdir -p src/utils
					mkdir -p src/config
					mkdir -p src/api
					mkdir -p src/reporting
					mkdir -p src/logging
					mkdir -p src/data


	* playwright.config.ts --> is the file to configure the Playwright
							- testDir: './src/tests'
									--> tells the framework where to find the test cases.  Here " . " means current folder.
	* Installing Browser Engines:
						Place to install the browser engines
							- Browser engines location C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\ms-playwright
							- Browser engines location C:\Users\91809\AppData\Local\ms-playwright
							https://chat.openai.com/share/16ccd5615-1b45-4e84-a7bc-ef4169f8f661
						The browser engines should already exist since you have installed Playwright.  If it not there in the above location, run the below command in the terminal to download.
							npx playwright install
							
						* ffmpeg is needed for Playwright Video recording
						
3. Creating Requirement.md file and Choosing AUT:
			* Creating Requirement.md file - create requirements.md file in the project root folder for documentation
			* Choosing Application Under Test - developer.salesforce.com/signup
												- while signup choose either 'Developer' or 'Administrator' in the "Role" Dropdown.
												
4. Page Object Chaining:  Creating instance of the next page(Home Page) in the current page(Login page) and returning that page is called the Page Object Chaining.
								Ex:  const homePage = new HomePage(this.page);
									 return homePage;

* Node JS is the run time environment 
* ESLint plugin is a popular open-source static code analysis tool for identifying and fixing common errors in JavaScript code.
  It helps developer adhere to coding standards and maintain a consistent code style across projects. This plugin will give you "Run As" UI option
* Playwright Test for VSCode is a plugin.  This will be like a runner.  It will helps us to do the thing faster rather than typing in the terminal.
